# MediBrief - AI-Powered Clinical Note Generator  

![MediBrief Logo](https://iili.io/FRzYAdP.png)

**MediBrief** is a Django-based web application that helps healthcare professionals generate structured clinical notes from unstructured patient data — including text, images (JPEG/PNG), PDFs, and DOCX files.  
It leverages **OpenAI's GPT-4o/GPT-3.5-turbo** for advanced AI-powered note generation and **EasyOCR** for multilingual OCR (English/Hindi) support.

## 🤖 How It Works

- User uploads a file (image, PDF, DOCX) or inputs text.

- OCR and AI extract and structure the content into a clinical note.

- The user can edit, save, or export the note as a PDF.

- Notes are securely stored with history tracking for future access.
